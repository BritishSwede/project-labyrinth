# Project Labyrinth

Project created by Linnea Isebrink and Rebecca Blixt. We created a labyrinth using React and Redux, fetching data from an API. 

## The problem

Our biggest issue this week has been time management due to the fact that we have different schedules. We solved this by working when we had the time and splitting up tasks between us. 

We used React, Redux, JSX, API, and styled components in this project. 

If we had more time we would've implemented a restart button, a history of where the user has been and stored the data in the local storage.
